# Artist Statement

Write your artist statement in this file (max 300 words).

Answer the following:

- How would you would like viewers to perceive the major project theme in your work?
- How does interaction enhance the viewerâ€™s experience?

My project theme is a battle filed after day time. The treacherous enemy attacks under the cover of night. The viewer needs to use a keyboard to control of the searchlight to provide a view for his soldiers.

There are three bridges in the battle field. Enemy soldiers have to go through these bridges to invade. Next to the bridges, our seven machine gunners defend their positions. 

An illuminated enemy soldier is much easier to kill. However, the searchlight is small and unwieldy at first, so the viewer has to practice his control skill.

As each night passes, technicians upgrade the searchlight during the day to make it more effective the next night. However, the enemy will also constantly adjust their tactics to gain greater advantage.

Evasion: enemy will learn to move from the searchlight area.

Separation: Because if enemies stay close, multiple enemies may be killed by a single bullet, they will learn to keep a distance from each other.

Team up: Every once in three nights, enemy will try teaming up as 6-member teams.

The learning process comes from the interaction with the viewer. If the viewer did well in using the searchlight, enemies will more quickly learn the evasion and separation skills. If the viewer did not use the searchlight a lot, enemies will slowly forget these skills. The probability of the born of the enemy with each skill is shown at the bottom left of the window.

If an enemy reaches the bottom of the window, an explosion will be caused.

To make the scene engaging, the sound of rooster, wolf, and guns are introduced to tell the user what is happening.
