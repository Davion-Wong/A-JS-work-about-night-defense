# Recent developments

This is an extra task specifically for students enrolled in the masters course (COMP6720). Students in the undergraduate course (COMP1720) can ignore this file.

My project reflects the recent development in Art and Computing by introducing the concept of evolving. The idea comes from Daniel Shiffman's book Nature Of Code.

To be specific, in my project, the enermy soilders evolve in the battles. Just like living things, enemy soldiers evolve, only it's not their bodies that evolve, it's their tactics.

At first, the enemy soldiers will only advance directly to our positions. If the viewer with the help of searchlight consistently succeed in subduing enemy soldiers on the battlefield, they will begin to try to evade, separate, or band together

The key is that they do not simply evolve certain one skill, but selectively evolve according to the effectiveness of each skill's battlefield practice.

When the stress of the battlefield is reduced, they will gradually forget some skills, because mastering many skills requires more time in training, which is not always necessary.

The probability of a new enemy with each skill is shown at the bottom left corner of the window.
